			<p><b>What do pointers look like?</b></p></li>
			<p>
			&emsp;<img src="resources/images/labeled_pointer.png" alt="Labeled Pointer"> (labeled)
			&emsp; or <img src="resources/images/unlabeled_pointer.png" alt="Unlabeled Pointer"> (unlabeled)
	 		</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Some <b>notes concerning the four special pointers:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <b>front pointer</b> is intended to point at the first node in the linked list, but note that the 	app will not automatically make the first node in the list the front pointer for you.</li>
		<li>The <b>rear pointer</b> is intended to point at the last node in the linked list, but, like the front 	pointer, the app will not do this for you.</li>
		<li>The <b>T and P pointers</b> are really just general purpose pointers. They aren’t intented to point at any node in particular, they’re meant to point at any node you’d like them to!</li>
	</ul>

 <p><b>Assignment</b></p>
 <ul>
	 <li>To redirect where any pointer in the center-left dropbox (in the topmost menu under 	‘Structures’) points to, just select that pointer from the left most dropbox, then
		 <ul>
			 <li>select ‘=’ from the dropdown immediately to the right</li>
			 <li>and finally select the destination node from the dropdown box to the right of the ‘=’ dropdown box.</li>
		 </ul>
	 </li>
	 <li>You can only assign new values to the pointers in the dropbox to the left of the equal sign. This means you may need to reposition the T and\or P pointers in order to access a node.</li>
 </ul>

 <p><b>Deletion</b></p>
 <ul>
	 <li>To delete a node, select ‘delete’ from the centermost dropdown (the same dropdown you’d select ‘=’ from), and then select the node you’d like to delete from the dropdown to the right.</li>
 </ul>

 <p><b>Undo</b></p>
 <ul>
	 <li>Yes, you can undo however many times you like.</li>
 </ul>
